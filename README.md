# Patient-registration-system

The project is proposed to be a patient registration website of hospitals with a brain tumor 
and Pneumonia detection. This project aims to minimize the hassle and time taken in the 
hospital. When you visit a hospital there is a lot of checkpoints that you need to go 
through. For example, you need to reach out to the receptionist to fill out the patient 
registration form then pay the bill for the form. Then wait for the patient logbook and 
register for an appointment with the concerned doctor which may take time, even a day. 
This website plans to eliminate this hassle by making the patient registration online. Users 
can fill out the registration form in their homes and make an appointment with a concerned 
doctor by just press of a button.
